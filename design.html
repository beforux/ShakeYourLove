			<h3 class="sub-title">Analysis</h3>
			<p>According to the questions below, I will analyze and examine them through competitive analysis, past research from TxDoT department, literature review and data analysis from media channel. </p>
			
			<p>From past research, participants were asked to indicate which adjectives from a list of words best described the TxDOT website.</p>

			<h3 class="sub-title">Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p>In competitve analysis, I explored two website to get insight from direct and indirect competitiors. One is UT news. The other is Spotify. </p>
			
			<h4 class="big-title">Search Bar always shows on the top.</h4>
			<p >As a content medium, all of pieces of infomatin should be designed for user to easy find. That is the essence of medium. In this function, search is a quite important tool to help user find what he/she wants with effectively and efficiently.</p>
           <h4 class="big-title">Navigation is everywhere.</h4>
           <p>It is like in a real world. Without signpost, we can not find the location. Sometimes, one signpost is not enough for us to find destination. We need look for one signpost after another during the trip to find the destination.</p>
           <h4 class="big-title">Well-orgranized categroy is important.</h4>
<p>Category is the tool to organize information. We always arrange our materials into different files. However, only the well-organized categroy can be exist for long time , easy to extend in the future and easy for user to understand and find.</p>
<h4 class="big-title">Search Bar</h4>
<p>disappear when user scroll down their pages.</p>
<p>located in the upper right position which make user hard to detect. From reserach, user eye will easily capture the left upper side zone.</p>

<h4 class="big-title">Bad organzied Category</h4>
<p>There is no realtionship between driver, government, business and careers. They are not parelled.</p>
<p>There is less relationship between driver, Inside TxDoT, Austin District, Contact Us, Distrcits, Business.</p>


   <img src="img/6.png">

        <p >‚Ä¢ Search bar prefer to be always clearly showing on the top. </p>
        <p >‚Ä¢ Navigation prefer to be everywhere.</p>

		<h3 class="sub-title">SME Interview</h3>
<p>In our SME ( Subject Matter Expert ) Interview, we invited
UT newsroom official to give us a lecture towards UT newsroom.</p>
<h4>Website build a direct channel to the audiences.</h4>
<p>Before website came into our eye, information, news, stories are transmitted by paid media. Website build a direct channel to the audiences, which is a benefit for any organization and business. So how to make use of this direct channel is main concern.
</p>
<h4>Write for direct audience</h4>
<p>Different channels have different audiences. For various channels, we write and share different kinds of articles to target audiences. For example, in Linkedin social media, we share professional information about career or softskills, in twitter social media, we share short stories.
</p>

<h4>Notice social media policy</h4>
<p>As an university social media, we should notice that our voice might stand for university‚Äôs attitude towards sensitive arguments. So, we have some policy. For example, ‚Äúdo not put opinion on the social media.‚Äù</p>

<h4>Metrics</h4>
<p>We are calculating KPI on ‚Äú share views ‚Äù of an article.</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">1 on 1 interview</h3>
<p>Interview begins at screening, we use a seris of questions to screen our users and pick up the suitable users to our 1 on 1 interview.

<img src="img/10.png">

<h4>Takeaway</h4>
<p>‚Ä¢ Website link is end with gov. means government which feel it is an official website.</br>
‚Ä¢ A lot of picture of people shows in the middle which made user
feel messy.</br>
‚Ä¢ No paralleled words. For example : driver and government is not
related; transportation is not related to the government.</br>
‚Ä¢ Keyword is not eye-catching.</br>
‚Ä¢ Words and picture should attract users, not too much tiny words.</br>
‚Ä¢ Topic words is not big enough and should be less words and more important words there.</br>
‚Ä¢ TXDOT ( DOT = ‚Äú.‚Äù ) sounds like a technology company.</p>

	<h3 class="sub-title">Usability Testing</h3>
	<p>This usability testing is conducted to evaluate the website http://www.txdot.gov usability. Its goal is to facilitate the development of TXDOT website.The website was assessed using the Think Aloud method ( Nielsen, 2012) , enabling the interviewees to independently finish two tasks in the website and after that make a metrics evaluation towards website.
Most of usability testing was conducted face to face. For remote usability testing, we used desktop sharing software to communicate.
After tests, we accumulate quantative and quality data and drew out weak points concerning the usability of website.</p>
<img src="img/11.png">
<h4>Takeaway</h4>
<h4 class="big-title">Too much content</h4>
<p>Too much content in the pages distracts user
from finishing their task. Some users even forgot what their task is when they want to finish tasks in the website pages even they have read aloud the task description just 1 minute ago.</p>
<h4 class="big-title">Less organized, No hierarchy</h4>
<p>In the search results page, the information is not well-organized.</p>
<h4 class="big-title">optimize the search result quality</h4>
<p>There exists too much similar information in the search results.Even the user search the right keywords, the files she wants to search is not in the first three results.</p>
<h4 class="big-title">put search bar in the vivid place</h4>
<p>Many user cannot notice search bar.</p>
